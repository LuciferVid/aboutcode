Project Idea
---------------
There is a large number of pending tickets for data sources. We want to
search for more vulnerability data sources and consume them . So I will
resolve this issues :

* `Add OSV importer #608 ( add support for more data source like OSS-Fuzz
  ,... ) <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/608>`_
* `Add support for CWE #651
  <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/651>`_
* `Collect UVI database #588
  <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/787>`_
* `Collect CMU CERT #588
  <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/588>`_
* `Add Fireeye disclosures #487
  <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/487>`_

Tasks Accomplished
-------------------
* `add a OSV importer <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/780>`_
* `Refactor Git-importer using fetchcode
  <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/817>`_
* `Import data from Fireeye
  <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/795>`_
* `Add support for CWE <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/782>`_
* `Import data from GSD <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/787>`_
* `Migrate ruby to new importers
  <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/799>`_

Post GSoC - Future Plans
-------------------------------------------
* add support for Cargo version and Version range
* add support for Git Version and Version range  , ...
