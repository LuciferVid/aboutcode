Overview
--------

The primary objective of this project was to fetch and integrate the
OpenSSF Scorecard data into the Scancode.io platform for all detected
packages, thereby enhancing its capabilities for security and community
health metrics analysis. The project involved work on two key repositories:
`Scorecode`,which was developed as a PyPI package, and `Scancode.io`, where
the integration with Scorecard data was implemented within scanning
pipelines.

**Scorecode**

`scorecode package <https://pypi.org/project/scorecode/>`_ serves as a PyPI
package that has the functions to fetch and store OpenSSF Scorecard data
using the OpenSSF public API (`https://api.securityscorecards.dev/
<https://api.securityscorecards.dev/>`_). It also includes Django mixin
models that can be extended and integrated into other platforms with
databases, such as Scancode.io and PurlDB, ensuring seamless utilization of
Scorecard data across various projects.



**Scancode.io**

In the `Scancode.io` project, I added a pipeline that interacts with the
`scorecode` package to fetch and store Scorecard data in the Scancode.io
database. The data can then be exported into various outputs like the
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) CycloneDX format (and SPDX too in the
future), providing insights into security and community health

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation
--------------

**1. Scorecode Repository:**

   - Developed a PyPI package to interact with the OpenSSF API and fetch
     Scorecard data to be used in other software packages and store it in
     appropriate objects.
   - Created Django mixin models to enable easy extension and integration
     of Scorecard data into platforms with databases like Scancode.io.

For more information, you can visit the `scorecode package on PyPI
<https://pypi.org/project/scorecode/>`_.


**2. Scancode.io Integration:**

   - Developed a pipeline within Scancode.io to call `Scorecode` functions,
     retrieve Scorecard data, and save it in the Scancode.io database.
   - Enhanced the existing SBOM export functionality to include Scorecard
     data, allowing for detailed security posture and community health
     metrics analysis in CycloneDX format.

**4. Testing:**

   - Conducted comprehensive testing across two primary repositories hosted
     on GitHub and GitLab to ensure accurate fetching, storage, and export
     of Scorecard data:

     - **GitHub**:

          - `nexB/scancode-toolkit
            <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_
          - `tensorflow/tensorflow
            <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`_
          - `apache/spark <https://github.com/apache/spark>`_

     - **GitLab**: `gitlab-org/gitlab
       <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab>`_

   - Verified seamless integration and accurate data retrieval across
     different package ecosystems supported by Scancode.io, ensuring that
     the Scorecard data aligns with the expected structure and content.

   - Implemented and executed automated test cases using `pytest`, which
     include:

     - Validation of key fields such as ``scoring_tool``,
       ``scoring_tool_version``, ``score_date``, ``score``,
       ``scoring_tool_documentation_url``, and ``checks``.

     - Type checks for each field to ensure data integrity.

     - URL validation to confirm that the documentation links are correctly
       formatted and point to the expected resources.

   - Added additional test cases for edge scenarios such as non-existent
     repositories, private repositories, and invalid input formats to
     ensure robustness and reliability.

Pre GSOC Work
-----------------------

Before GSoC officially started, I had the opportunity to contribute to the
`ScanCode.io <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io>`_ and
`purldb.io <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/purldb>`_  project. During
this period, I focused on enhancing various functionalities and laying the
groundwork for the upcoming integration of the OpenSSF Scorecard. Below is
a list of key pull requests I made:

- `Add endpoint to create or update a package set
  <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/purldb/pull/350>`_
- `Fixes Github Mapper route
  <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/purldb/pull/370>`_
- `removed redundant PackageViewSet class code and added history field into
  package API nexB#389 nexB#221
  <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/purldb/pull/390>`_
- `alpine url bug fix and AGPL License version issue
  <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/pull/3744>`_

These contributions were essential in building a solid foundation for the
integration of the ScoreCode repository during GSoC.

Post GSoC
---------

After GSoC, the goal is to merge the pull requests into their respective
repositories, enabling users to leverage the OpenSSF Scorecard integration
for enhanced vulnerability analysis in Scancode.io. Future work includes
extending this integration to other platforms like PurlDB.
