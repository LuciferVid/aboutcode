scancode.io Documentation GSoD Case Study
=========================================


`AboutCode.org <https://www.aboutcode.org/>`_ is a community of open source
developers who are trying to make open source easier to use by providing
open source tools to discover, identify and track open source components
(aka. Software Composition Analysis - SCA). AboutCode is the collective
name for these open source tools.

Problem Statement

<https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jW2ogyALIBNsVpHhQ0EbBKzpfPF8BJzmT4vCfU3sQso/edit&>`_

Our focus for GSoD 2021 is Scancode.io and these specific tasks:

    - Create a HowTo guide for integrating third-party libraries into a
      ScanCode.io Pipeline.
    - Add a tutorial for adding a new Pipeline with a third-party library.
    - Extend the HowTo Guides to cover Software Composition Analysis
      workflows
    - Upgrade the ScanCode.io Web UI documentation
    - Create an introductory `video
      <https://opensource.com/article/21/3/video-open-source-tools>`_ to
      show how the web UI is used.
    - Update and improve the existing Pipe libraries reference API
      documentation (which is generated from code documentation
      "docstrings").
    - Sync the new documentation set with the code to support continuous
      integration.

Project Description
-------------------

Creating the proposal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ScanCode.io is an open platform to script and automate Software Composition
Analysis (SCA) for many different use cases including development
codebases, package dependencies, and Docker, Virtual Machine images, or
other containers. With the ScanPipe feature of ScanCode.io, you can create
any number of Pipelines to integrate SCA into your development process. A
Pipeline may include libraries beyond those available from AboutCode.org.
This flexibility means that we need much more extensive HowTo, Tutorials,
and Reference documentation to help our users build their own Pipelines.
ScanCode.io also offers a Web UI that needs a new  Tutorial and HowTo
documentation.

Although we already offer a few Pipeline templates, our users need to be
self-sufficient to adapt these templates or add new Pipelines in order to
fit SCA into their own environment. We also want to encourage users to
contribute back improvements to our templates or new Pipeline templates.
Both of these objectives require more and better documentation.

Budget
^^^^^^

Our budget for the project was $15,000 which was allocated completely to
the technical writer working on the project.

Participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The primary participant was technical writer `Hanan Younes
<https://github.com/hyounes4560>`_ who responded to our announcement
describing the project scope, and was the clear choice among the many
responders based on multiple criteria including clarity of vision and the
ability to execute the project goals.

The primary mentor is a regular contributor to AboutCode.org projects and
the primary maintainer of ScanCode.io:

- `Thomas Druez <https://github.com/tdruez>`_

Additional mentoring was provided by:

- `Philippe Ombredanne <https://github.com/pombredanne>`_
- `Michael Herzog <https://github.com/mjherzog>`_
- `Dennis Clark <https://github.com/DennisClark>`_
- `Ayan Sinha Mahapatra <https://github.com/AyanSinhaMahapatra>`_

As an exceptionally thoughtful and articulate analyst, Hanan Younes offered
much useful feedback and many questions that encouraged the project mentors
to improve their planning and organization. We learned how valuable a clear
roadmap and directions can be to a technical writer.

Timeline
^^^^^^^^

We planned that the technical writer would work on our project ⅓ to ½ time
over a period of 5 months (May to October, 2021). Results

The documentation for ScanCode.io was dramatically improved. See
`scancode.io RTD <https://scancodeio.readthedocs.io>`_

The documentation is now well organized into Getting Started, Tutorial, and
Reference sections, each of which provides a wealth of information.

Tracking
^^^^^^^^

We used GitHub Projects to manage and track the project.  All expectations
were met or exceeded.

Analysis
^^^^^^^^

- Hanan executed all tasks beautifully.
- We found that we needed to dig deeper into ScanCode.io to respond to
  Hanan's many questions and comments.
- The project was very successful and provided everyone with the
  opportunity to grow and learn. We are very pleased with the documentation
  that is now available to the open source community.

Summary
^^^^^^^

- Clear organization of project documentation is essential.
- We may wish to articulate more “stretch goals” in future projects.
- Be sure to define exactly what you want to accomplish.
- Be sure to plan project communication standards, such as a Gitter channel
  and regularly scheduled status meetings.

Appendix
--------

We received more than twenty proposals, and are grateful to the interest
shown in AboutCode.org by the open source community.

Process Feedback to Google
--------------------------

The overall process for the GSoD went well, but we faced a few issues,
mostly self-inflicted that we are listing here for reference:

- Since we were not sure if our org would be accepted, we started late
  working on actual recruitment. Recruitment ended up taking much more time
  than planned. This means we had to scramble when our org was accepted to
  get our selected candidate on-boarded and starting the project.
- In contrast with the GSoC project, there is no infrastructure for
  candidates to submit a project proposal. It was not an issue for us, but
  we felt after the fact that a GSoC-like infrastructure to funnel
  submissions would have been a nice addition.
- There was no clear contract or agreement in place with our selected
  candidate and this led to some misunderstanding between us with regard to
  payments. This ended up being a source of anxiety for our doc writer and
  a situation we decided to address directly. AboutCode is sponsored by
  nexB which is a commercial company and nexB accepted to make a donation
  to the AboutCode OpenCollective as a bridge to provide advanced payments
  to our doc writer. For future participation, we will manage this process
  proactively to avoid such ambiguity.
- While we have been proactively managing the process with our doc writer
  with weekly meetings and continuous discussions in chat channels, we
  mentors collectively have not been great at providing timely feedback to
  GSoD administrators about our progress which is something that we would
  need to improve for the future.
