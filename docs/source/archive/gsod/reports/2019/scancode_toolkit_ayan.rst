Project Overview
----------------

#. **Restructured Documentation hosted at ReadTheDocs:** Outdated
   Documentation from GitHub Wikis was updated, improved and converted to
   .RST, to be hosted at aboutcode.readthedocs.io.

#. **Documentation Tests and Roadmaps:** Documentation tests were added to
   check Documentation Builds, Internal/External Links, and Style
   Standards. These tests were added in both aboutcode and scancode-toolkit
   and already existing/new documentation was made compliant of these
   tests.

#. **Command Line Options Referance:** The entire Command Line Options were
   listed, explained, and their application elaborated from scratch. This
   is the main goal and the most important addition to the scancode-toolkit
   documentation.

#. **Migration of Scancode-Toolkit docs into its own Repository:** After
   adding the scancode toolkit docs to aboutcode and reviews, this section
   was migrated to its own repository, to be distributed with
   scancode-toolkit and with local builds enabled.

#. **[WIP] Improve/Add to Existing Tutorials/How-Tos:** Added two major
   Tutorials and other Tutorials/How-Tos were also updated to be consistent
   with the latest scancode versions and more Tutorials/How-Tos can be
   added later to better help the users.

#. **[WIP] Add Plugin Support:** A cookiecutter based plugin creation
   system has to be added, and relevant docs for this process and for the
   plugin architecture has to be added.

#. **[WIP] Solve Other Documentation Issues:** Solving multiple issues
   listed under the tag "Documentation".
