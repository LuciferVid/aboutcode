.. _GSoD2020:


Google Season of Docs 2020
==========================

AboutCode.org is applying to be a mentoring organization for the `Google
Season of Docs (GSoD) 2020
<https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs>`_.

In the event that our application is accepted, we'll be looking for fellow
members of the FOSS community with technical writing skills and an interest
in helping.  If you're interested, keep reading to get a sense of what we
have in mind for GSoD 2020.

AboutCode Overview
------------------

AboutCode is a family of FOSS projects for Software Composition Analysis
(SCA) and FOSS Compliance:

* Where does code come from?
* What is its license?
* What is its origin and copyright?
* Is the code secure, maintained, well coded?

All of these questions are important, and are relevant to millions of free
and open source software components available on the web for reuse. The
answers are critical to ensure that anyone and everyone can safely consume
free and open source software.

*Join us to make it so!*

Our tools are used to detect and report the origin and license of source
code, packages and binaries as well as to discover software and package
dependencies. We are also working on projects to track security
vulnerabilities, bugs and other important software package attributes.

AboutCode Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our focus for GSoD 2020 is on `ScanCode Toolkit
<https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_ and `Scancode Workbench
<https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench>`_, but proposals to improve
the documentation for other AboutCode projects are welcome.

See :ref:`aboutcode-project-overview` for a complete list of AboutCode
projects.

Technology
~~~~~~~~~~

We primarily use Python for AboutCode software. There is also some code in
C/C++ or other languages. We use Electron/JavaScript for the ScanCode
Workbench desktop application.

Our domain includes text analysis and processing (e.g., for copyright and
license detection), parsing (for package manifest formats), binary analysis
(to detect the origin and license of binaries), web-based tools and APIs
(to expose the tools and libraries as web services) and low-level data
structures for efficient matching (such as Aho-Corasick and other
automata).

For documentation we primarily use reStructured Text files with Sphinx and
ReadTheDocs. For command line tools we use text files for help
documentation. There is still some project documentation in project wikis,
but our goal is to migrate that to ReadTheDocs. For each project there will
also be a README and a few other files in the corresponding GitHub
repository.

Contact Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Join the chat online or by IRC at
https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/gsod-season-of-docs. Introduce yourself and
start the discussion!

You can also contact:

- the primary org admin directly: @pombredanne and pombredanne@gmail.com
- the GSoD coordinator directly: jmhoran@nexb.com

Technical Writing Skills Needed
-------------------------------

Incoming technical writers will need the following skills:

- Ability to install and configure open source code from GitHub.
- Ability to understand and run programs from the command line in a
  terminal window.
- An interest in FOSS licensing and software code and origin analysis.

During the application process and during a GSoD project with us you will
learn how to:

- Design and create documentation as Tutorials, HowTo Guides, Reference or
  Discussions.

  - See https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/ for more information
    about this approach.

- Create and edit documentation files in reStructured Text.
- Manage documentation files with Sphinx.
- Publish documentation to ReadTheDocs.

We are happy to help you get up to speed. The more you are able to
demonstrate ability and skills in advance, the more likely we are to choose
your application!

About Your Project Application
------------------------------

Your application should be in the range of 1,000 words, and should contain
the following information, plus anything else that you think is relevant:

- Your name and contact details.

- Title of your proposal.

- Abstract of your proposal.

- Description of your idea including an explanation of what it will
  contribute to the project.

- Description of previous work, existing solutions, open-source projects,
  preferably with links.

- Details of your academic studies and any previous internships.

- Description of your relevant skills.

- Do you plan to have any other commitments during GSoD that may affect
  your work? Any vacations/holidays? Will you be available full time to
  work on your project? Please apply only if this is a serious full time
  commitment during the GSoD time frame.

Join the chat online or by IRC at
https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/gsod-season-of-docs. Introduce yourself and
start a discussion!

An excellent, competitive way to demonstrate your capability would be to
submit a documentation improvement to an AboutCode project, especially to
ScanCode Toolkit or ScanCode Workbench.

You can pick a project idea from the list below. You can also submit `Your
Documentation Project Ideas <#your-documentation-project-ideas-2020>`_.

Our Documentation Project Ideas
-------------------------------

Note that the AboutCode focus for GSoD 2020 is on ScanCode Toolkit and
ScanCode Workbench, although proposals to improve the documentation for
other AboutCode projects are welcome.

`Your Documentation Project Ideas
<#your-documentation-project-ideas-2020>`_ are welcome too! Please chat
about them to increase your chances of success!

Your Documentation Project Ideas
--------------------------------

Download and install `ScanCode Toolkit
<https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_ and `Scancode Workbench
<https://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench>`_ and try them out. For
example, you may try scanning an open source software package in a
technology with which you are familiar. What are the documentation weak
points?


* Is it difficult to get started? A **Tutorial** documentation opportunity.
* Is it difficult to accomplish a specific objective? A **How-To**
  documentation opportunity.
* Are the capabilities of the tool too mysterious? Do you want to know more
  about what you can do with it? A **Reference** documentation opportunity.
* Do you feel that you need to understand its concepts better in order to
  use it and trust it? Do you want to know more about how the code scanning
  actually works? A **Discussion** documentation opportunity.

Feel free to propose and describe your own documentation ideas.

Mentoring
---------

We welcome new mentors to help with the program. We require some
