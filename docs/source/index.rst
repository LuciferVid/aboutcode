Welcome to the AboutCode documentation homepage. `AboutCode.org <https://www.aboutcode.org/>`_ is
a community of open source developers who are trying to make open source easier to use by providing
open source tools to discover, identify and track open source components
(aka Software Composition Analysis â€“ SCA). AboutCode is the collective name for these
open source tools.

This home page provides a directory of our major projects and their documentation on ReadTheDocs
plus information about how to contribute to AboutCode documentation.

All community contributions are welcome.
